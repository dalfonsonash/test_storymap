                <h2>Welcome to our Project Overview! </h2>
                <p>We are David, Leo, and Payson and we made a lot of maps.</p>
                <p>For this project, we used:</p>
                <p>API and CSV to generate data, Python and Pandas to clean data, and SQL to store data and exacute queries.</p>
                <p>We also used Flask and Jinja, Leaflet and it's plugins, HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for styling...</p>

            <section data-place="cluster">
                <h2>Starting with a Cluster Map</h2>
                <p>The first thing we did was make a cluster map. It was a nice place to begin because we had a solid example from which to jump.</p>
                <p>The scores are color coated on the markers, and we added a search control - a plugin we had not yet used.</p>
                <p>The marker here in the story map is relativley abitrary. It is the Lat and Long of Benu, a fancy SF resturant that I used repeatedly to see if the search function worked.</p>
                <p>The Leaflet plugin did not allow for searching clustered markers, so we had to create a separate layer of invisible markers to search.</p>
                <p>You can check out both the code for the invisible markers and the map itself below.</p>

                <h2>Over the Years...</h2>
                <p>We took the database provided by the SF goverment and set up a map to filter data by the year, incident type, and score.</p>
                <p>The data provided was over the years of 2016-2019</p>
                <p>The pandemic halted inspections for awhile so there is some funky data in there and a few resturants out there that exist and have not been updated in either the database or the API</p>

            <section data-place="sunflower">
                <h2>Sunflower Restaurant</h2>
                <p>We did SQL queries to find out which resturants were the worst!</p>
                <p>Over the period of provided data, Sunflower had the lowest avg score at around 56</p>
                <p>We also used Flask to take the API data and convert it into a DataFrame. Using Python and Pandas, we extracted only the restaurants with recent incidents categorized as high-risk.</p>
                <p>First, we rendered the restaurants variable to the template:</p>
                <img src="static/images/render_to_template.png" alt="Render Image">
                <p>Then we called the Jinja variables in HTML while converting it to JSON:</p>
                <img src="static/images/html_jinja.png" alt="HTML_Jinja Image">
                <p>Lastly, we accessed the restaurants variable directly in our script as a normal variable:</p>

                <p>Check it out running on localhost.</p>

                <p>Lee's was pretty gross</p>
                <p>From our SQL queries we found that no only </p>
                <p>Lee's had lots of incidents and a low avg rating</p>
                <p> Something else. Blah</p>

                <p>It may not be good, but it is safe.</p>
                <p>We found that out of the 159 spots with good inpections, 70+ were schools.</p>
                <p> Our queries found that Alice Fong Young's School did the best and the marked on our story map.<p>
                <p>In case you are wondering, Sts. Peter and Paul School did the worst.</p>
